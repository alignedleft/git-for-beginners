        Console, Commandline or Commandline Interface (CLI) is a textbased

        Still many computer experts, programmers and alike are using the console

    <Fragment>
      <p>
        A branch is basically a chain of{' '}

        support work in a team on different parts of your projects at the same
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Branches also allow you to try out new ideas and concepts without
        risking changes in the main version stored for example in the{' '}
        <code>master</code> branch.
